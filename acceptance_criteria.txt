General Functionality

    Data Extraction:
        The pipeline should successfully connect to the Congress API using an API key.
        It should support fetching data for a user-specified date or date range.
        The data extraction should handle pagination if the API provides results across multiple pages.
        If the API request fails (e.g., timeout, invalid key), the pipeline should log the error and retry a configurable number of times.

    Data Transformation:
        The extracted data should be cleaned and validated to ensure no null or invalid values in required fields.
        The data should be normalized to a consistent format (e.g., date fields converted to YYYY-MM-DD, string trimming, standardizing keys/column names).
        Transformation should include extracting relevant fields (e.g., bill ID, title, sponsor, status, summary).
        Duplicate records should be removed based on unique identifiers (e.g., bill ID).

    Data Loading:
        The transformed data should be stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV file, SQLite database, or another specified target).
        If using a database, the schema must include tables for key entities (e.g., bills, sponsors).
        The pipeline should support appending new data without overwriting existing records.

Error Handling and Logging

    Error Logging:
        All errors during extraction, transformation, or loading should be logged with timestamps and error details.
        Warnings should be logged for non-critical issues (e.g., missing optional fields).

    Retries:
        The pipeline should retry failed API requests up to a configurable number of attempts before logging a failure and skipping.

    Validation:
        Data should be validated at each step (e.g., API response status, transformed data format) with clear error messages for invalid inputs or unexpected formats.

Performance

    Scalability:
        The pipeline should handle large volumes of data efficiently (e.g., by processing data in chunks or pages).

    Efficiency:
        The pipeline should complete execution within a reasonable time frame for typical use cases (e.g., fetching data for one day).

User Interaction

    Input Flexibility:
        Users should be able to specify input parameters, such as:
            Date or date range.
            Specific endpoint or filters (e.g., bills, amendments, nominations).
        If no parameters are provided, the pipeline should fetch data for the current day by default.

    Output Options:
        Users should be able to specify the output format (e.g., CSV, JSON, SQLite database).
        Users should be able to specify the output directory or database connection string.

Documentation

    Code Documentation:
        The Python code should include clear comments and docstrings explaining each function and its purpose.

    User Guide:
        Provide a README file with:
            Installation instructions.
            Setup guide for API keys.
            Example usage of the ETL pipeline.
            Explanation of the output schema.

Testing

    Unit Tests:
        Write unit tests for critical functions (e.g., API connection, data transformation, and loading logic).
        Ensure tests cover edge cases (e.g., empty API response, invalid data).

    Integration Testing:
        Test the pipeline end-to-end with sample data to verify correctness.

Success Criteria

    The ETL pipeline should execute successfully with no unhandled errors for valid inputs.
    The output data should match the defined schema and contain only valid, unique, and relevant records.
    All log files and error reports should provide sufficient detail for debugging.
    The pipeline should meet the specified performance benchmarks (e.g., process 100 records in under a minute).
